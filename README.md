# STORE-STOCK-PROJECT v1.0
<p>
> This software was developed with the assumption to meet the real demands of a friend's store<br> 
> It is just an exercise for me to practice my Java programming skills<br>
> Made with a maven project and has JSON, Commons IO and maven core dependencies<br>
> It also uses JDK14<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>All data is translated into a JSON format and stored in a txt file</li>
<li>The manipulation methods search for the specific line of each stored item</li>
<li>The txt file line number functions as a primary key</li> <li>The manipulation performs at the indicated key, rewriting the line and updating the "database"</li><br>
<br>
> I emphasize that this program was developed in early 2020 to train what I was studying at the time (Java IO and JSON) and for this reason it does not use real database programs
> This exercise was extremely useful to consolidate my knowledge<br>
